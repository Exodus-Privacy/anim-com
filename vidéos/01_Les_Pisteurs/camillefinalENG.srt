1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Everyday,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,900
Camille uses applications

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,400
on her phone

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,900
and they are very useful

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,500
For example

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,000
to know the weather,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,900
to check her bank account,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,500
or her glycemia

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
because Camille is diabetic.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
But, what Camille doesn't know

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,900
is that in each of these applications

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,000
there are trackers.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
These trackers have been added

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,900
when the application was created

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,400
with the sole purpose of

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,000
collecting data.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Such as

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
where Camille lives

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,000
where she works

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
or the drugstore

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,500
where she gets her treatment.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,000
These trackers allow the person

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
who created the application to

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,000
first, be able to know who uses the application

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to know the audience,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
but also,

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
if they offer advertising

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,800
to target it as much as they can.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,600
In fact, the more targeted an ad is,

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,500
the more efficient it becomes,

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
so the more money it makes.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Finally, 

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the creator of the app

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
can sell the data collected by the trackers.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,700
But Camille does not like that very much,

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,800
all these trackers

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,200
collecting things about her without her knowning.

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,700
So now, Camille,

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,000
when she installs a new application

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,300
she goes first to the Exodus Privacy website.

41
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,000
This platform analyzes

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the free applications available on Google Store

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,300
and detects the presence or the lack of trackers on it.
