1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Everyday,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,900
Camille is using applications

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,400
on her phone

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,900
and they are very usefull

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,500
for example

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,000
for the weather

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,900
her bank account,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,500
or her glycemia

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
because Camille is diabetic.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
But, Camille doesn't know

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,900
that in every application

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,000
there are some trackers

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
These trackers has been added

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,900
when the application was created

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,400
in one and only purpose

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,000
to collect data.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
For example,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
the place where Camille lives

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,000
The place where she works

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
or the drugstore

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,500
where she gets her treatment.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Thanks to these trackers,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
the creator of the application 

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,000
first, the avability to know who's use the appl

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to know about the public,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
but also,

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
if the application uses advertising

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,800
to target then with maximum accurate.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,600
More an advert is targeted,

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,500
more it usefull,

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
and them more it makes money.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
At least, 

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the person who created the application

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
can resale the data collected by the trackers.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,700
And Camille does not like very much,

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,800
all these trackers

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,200
collecting things about her without her knowning.

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,700
So now, Camille,

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,000
when she install a new application

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,300
she go fist to the Exodus Privacy website.

41
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,000
This platform do analysis

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
on the free Google Store apps

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,300
and check if there is trackers on it.
