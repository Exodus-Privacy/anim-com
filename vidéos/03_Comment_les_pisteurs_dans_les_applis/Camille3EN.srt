1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Previously, in Camille's adventures

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Camile use every day

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
some applications on her smartphone

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,200
but she discovered the existance of trackers

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,800
those little piece of code

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,000
who collect informations about her.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
She realizes 

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,100
that this data can affect 
very sensitive domains

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,200
like her illness or her sexual orientation.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,700
Camille ask her self

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,000
How those trackers came into the applicationss?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
An Exodus Privacy video

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,000
In order to answer this question

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,900
Camille must understand

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,000
how applications are made

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
An application, it's a little bit like a car.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They all have a goal:

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,500
helping Cammille to do her shopping,

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
going gambling,

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or post a package.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,300
They are both complex to build.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,800
a lot of stuff

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
and many differents professions participate to the creation. 

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
In order to build the engine,

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,800
there is two choices for the engineers.

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,700
create the engine from scratch

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,500
or use an already created engine.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's the same for an application!

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,650
Developers,

30
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,600
the person who write code in computer language

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,800
could choose to use an already done piece of code

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,000
in library code

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
or write all the application code, from scratch.

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Ok. So when did the trackers come into the applications?

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,700
A traker, it's a piece of code.

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,000
So someone has to write at a time

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in the application program

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,800
It could be from the persons who wrote the applications

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,700
for example to have revenues for adverts.

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,300
But some time those persons does not even know they've added a tracker.

41
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,800
For example, if a developer use a piece of code wrote by others

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
which use geoloc whitout her knowledge,

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,900
the final application will have a tracker.

44
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,300
And if Camille install it on her smartphone,

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,900
she will be tracked through this

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,140
As we can find the same engine in differents cars,

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,900
We can find same trackers in many applications.

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,800
To keep an eye on Camille adventure,

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,150
